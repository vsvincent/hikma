# Fortgeschrittene Softwaretechnik Projekt "Hikma"
- Use and understand Git!
- UML at least 3 good different diagrams. "good" means you can pump it up artificially as written in DDD. You have 10 million $ from me! Please export the pics. I can not install all tools to view them!
- DDD If your domain is too small, invent other domains around and document these domains (as if you have 10 Mio â‚¬ from Edlich-Investment!) Develop a clear strategic design with mappings/relationships with 5-0 Domains. It would be nice if these domains are derived from an Event-Storming (but not mandatory). 
- Metrics at least two. Sonarcube would be great. Other non-trivial metrics are also fine.
- Clean Code Development: A) at least 5 points you can show me with an explanation of why is this is clean code in your code and/or what has improved & B) >>10 points on your personal CCD cheat sheet. E.g. a PDF.
- Build Management with any Build System as Ant, Maven, Gradle, etc. (only Travis is perhaps not enough) Do e.g. generate Docs, call tests, etc. (it could be also disconnected from the project just to learn a build tool!)
- Integrate some nice Unit-Tests in your Code to be integrated into the Build
- Continuous Delivery: show me your pipeline using e.g. Jenkins, Travis-CI, Circle-CI, GitHub Action, GitLab CI, etc. E.g. you can also use Jenkins Pipelining or BlueOcean, etc. But at least insert more than 2 script calls as done in the lecture! (e.g. also call Ant or Gradle or something else).
- Use a good IDE and get fluent with it: e.g. IntelliJ. What are your favorite Key-Shortcuts?!
- DSL Create a small DSL Demo example snippet in your code even if it does not contribute to your project (hence it can also be in another language).
- Functional Programming: prove that you have covered all functional aspects in your code as:
- - only final data structures
- - (mostly) side effect free functions
- - the use of higher-order functions
- - functions as parameters and return values
- - use closures / anonymous functions
- - You can also do it outside of your project. Even in another language as F#, Clojure, Julia, etc.
